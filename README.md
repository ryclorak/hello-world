# hello-world
how about it what's the haps i don't know who git is.

I want to learn how to program.

More than that, though, I want to learn how to work with computers and emerging technology more generally.

More than that, I want to change my life. I want to start becoming who I feel like I can be. 

I want to do important things, not just dream about them.
